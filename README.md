## Implementation of a Database of Bass Heroes


In this repository you can find a file named ```bassists.py``` that implements the ```get_bassist``` and ```get_band``` functions. These functions check if the given input is a valid name of a bass player, or band respectively. They are used in the ```main.py``` file to test if a given bass player plays in a certain band. If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you the following results:

```
Les Claypool plays for Primus
Sorry, Young Signorino does not seem to be a known bassist
The bass hero of King Crimson is Tony Levin
Sorry, we don't know who is the bass hero of Pooh
```
ciao a tutti
ciao Corinne
You can (optionally) add functionalities to this basic behaviour (e.g., other band members) or adapt the template for other applications like sport players and teams.
